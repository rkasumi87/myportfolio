					 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You used to call me on my cell phone. Late night when you need my love. Call me on my cell phone. Late night when you need my love. And I know when that hotline bling. That can only mean one thing. I know when that hotline bling. That can only mean one thing. Ever since I left the city you. Got a reputation for yourself now. Everybody knows and I feel left out. Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out. 
					 <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause ever since I left the city, you. Started wearing less and goin' out more. Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor. Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before. You used to call me on my cell phone. Late night when you need my love. Call me on my cell phone. Late night when you need my love. And I know when that hotline bling. That can only mean one thing. I know when that hotline bling. That can only mean one thing. 
					  <br>
					  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days, all I do is. Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else. Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else. Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else. You don't need no one else. You don't need nobody else, no.    
				</p>
				<p class="text2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why you never along. Why you always touching road. Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else. You don't need no one else. You don't need nobody else, no. Why you never along. Why you always touching road.   You used to call me on my cell phone. Late night when you need my love. Call me on my cell phone. Late night when you need my love. And I know when that hotline bling. That can only mean one thing.
